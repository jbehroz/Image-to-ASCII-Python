# Image-to-ASCII-Python
Takes an image and produces an ASCII text file and console output from it. Uses the public library Pillow.

This uses the OOP class feature in python and the public library Pillow to open an image, turn it into grayscale, resize it, associate an ASCII character with every pixel, seperate the ASCII string with a newline character every 100 characters, save the ASCII into a .txt file, and print it out into the console in that order.
